To start understanding C, we must know how to construct a simple C program. Let's start by creating a main program.

Main program consists the following:
int main() {
	return 0;
}

Try to create your own main file named as main.c using VIM! Hint: Type vim main.c:
# Waits for user to input vim main.c
